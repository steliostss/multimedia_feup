### Task1 - Beat Tapping (Sonic Visualizer)

We followed the instructions mentioned in the pdf file and created the taps in file: **tap_example1.wav**.

As you can see in the image above, taps marked by me are noted with purple and they seems to match some peaks of the audio signal. 

By listening the audio with the taps (*clicks*) we could tell that the taps matched the rhythm of the music file.

### Task 2 - Beat tracking (Python - notebook *.ipynb)
